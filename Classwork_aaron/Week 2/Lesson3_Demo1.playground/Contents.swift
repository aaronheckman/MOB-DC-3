//My First Program
let string = "Hello World!"

/* 
let is a keyword, 
it means constant.
*/


//My Second Program
var day = "Wednesday"
day = "Thursday"

//Variables are mutable (unlike constants), SWIFT wants you to have constants

let age: Int = 23
let implicitAge = 23

//I am setting a constant named age to an integer that is equal to 23
//Using a ':' is type casting, onyl accepts integers
//Int are always whole numbers

let balance: Float = 10.01
let gender: Bool = true
let name: String = "Aaron"

let example = 5
var  example1 = 5
example1 = 10
